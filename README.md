# Tic-tac-toe-demo
Attached is a demonstration of a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented with a WebSocket server and a Unity client.

# WebSocket Server

Source Folder: ~/Websocket_server
Requirements: Node.js, ws package
To start the server, please run index.js. The server is configured to listen on localhost:8080.

# Unity Client Game
Source Folder: ~/TicTacToe
Note: The GameController.cs script manages the connection to the WebSocket server, as well as sending and receiving data. This implementation serves as a simplified demonstration utilizing WebSockets, as I encountered difficulties connecting to the websocket application mentioned in the test.
Please note that my familiarity with Node.js is limited, and therefore, the security aspects of the WebSocket server may not be robust.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
